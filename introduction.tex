\chapter{Introduction} \label{introduction} 


\par It is a reality that the World Wide Web in recent years, is growing
exponentially, which means the presence of millions of users on Web sites, Web
applications, Web systems, etc. \cite{albert1999internet}. There is a wide variety of Web systems,
where we have different users interacting with them. These users have different
goals when using these Web systems. For example to serching  in Google
\cite{google} for a particular topic, make a reservation for a room in a luxury
resort, check their bank account or simply checking their Facebook account
status \cite{cockburn2001web}.This variation of users represents a complex diversity as individuals
[]. This diversity lies in the fact that users have different skills, interests,
preferences, knowlage defferent  ways of thinking and learning.For this
reason users most to interact with the information presented by existing Web
systems. \par When we intend to customize any element in Web system,  it is
necessary to some personal information about the user. This information is a
collection of needs, characteristics, tastes, preferences among others.  This
information allows designers to build a representation of knowledge about the
users. This is what is known as user modeling (UM).    
\par  In order to
understand specific users a user model must be constructed, this can be simple
as a profile where the basic knowledge recorded. Or it can be as complex as
complete representation of it's characteristics, needs, interests and
preferences. In order to understand specific users. The main goal of user
modeling is to represent aspects of the real world of the user's in an autonomous
way.

\par On the other hand, interactive evolutionary computation (IEC)
is a branch of evolutionary computation where users become a part of the
evolutionary process by replacing the fitness function; evaluating individuals
of a population based on their personal preferences[13]. These evaluations are
subjective according to the user point of view based on their perceptions,
interests and desires.  
\par Normally such systems require users to evaluate large amounts of individuals 
actively, causing them to lose interest in participating by the fatigue that 
is generated[13]. Nowadays some of these systems
are migrating to  Web technologies looking for volunteer users to collaborate
in the evaluation for distribute the load and lower the fatigue. Having Web-
based interactive evolutionary systems opens the possibility of linking to social networks 
platforms in order to involve a larger number of users to assist in
the evaluation of individuals produced by these systems.

\par This research presents a user-cetered framework that involves several techniques 
such as graph-based user modeling, fuzzy logic and human-interaction in the context 
of a Web-based interactive evolutionary computation. The purpose of this research 
is to increase voluntary participation of the users  using the proposed framework.

\section{Outline}



\begin{itemize}  
\item \textbf{Chapter 2}, describes an in-depth study
 of current and related works, presenting a general
overview of Interactive evolutionary computation and their evolution in the pass and recent years, also user model approaches and finally gamification paradingm.
This study includes Interactive evolutionary computations methods
and techniques to understad how they work, as well as their problems
of these systems. On the other hand this study also includes user modeling methods in order to understad how to create and apply them for certain necesities. Finally we discussed a gammification usability paradigm to undertad how it work and subsequently apply this
for the necesities of this work.  
\item \textbf{Chapter 3}, describes the fundamental
concepts that form the basis of the proposed user-cetered framework.
\item \textbf{Chapter 4}, presents a user-centered framework for intereractive Web-based
applications, this proposed framework involves diferent paradigms in order to increse
user participation. This chapter also includes the
overall explanation of how the functionality the proposed framework works.
\item \textbf {Chapter 5}, the case study is presented along with the explanation
of the experimentation for this work. The experiments were realized using several versions of
the same application in order to see wich of them have most user participation.
\item \textbf {Chapter 6}, The results of the case study are presented. This chapter includes all the data obtained from the experiments, these data are presented to see which of the versions meets the best performance regarding the increase of participation of users.
\item \textbf {Chapter 7}, finally the conclusions and future work of this research are exposed.
